# Java OOP University Labs

This repository contains a collection of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** laboratory assignments developed during my Computer Engineering studies at **Politecnico di Torino**.  
All projects are written in **Java** and follow clean, modular, and test-driven practices using **Maven** and JUnit.

## Repository structure

- **lab0-simple-calculator**  
  Introductory Java project implementing a simple arithmetic calculator with basic I/O handling and unit tests. Focus on:
  - Java basics (classes, methods, types)
  - Simple console I/O
  - Maven project structure and JUnit tests

- **lab1-university**  
  Object-oriented model of a **university system** with students, courses, exams, and statistics. Focus on:
  - Designing classes and relationships
  - Encapsulation and collections
  - Managing registrations, exams, and simple reporting

- **lab2-hydraulics**  
  Simulation of a **hydraulic system** composed of sources, taps, splits, sinks, and multi-splits. Focus on:
  - Modeling interconnected components
  - Polymorphism and inheritance
  - Flow propagation and simulation observers

- **lab3-diet**  
  A small **diet and nutrition management** system that handles foods, recipes, menus, restaurants, customers, and orders. Focus on:
  - Interfaces and abstraction (`NutritionalElement`)
  - Composition of objects (recipes, menus)
  - Data aggregation and basic business logic

- **lab4-huts**  
  A **mountain huts and municipalities** information system working from CSV data. Focus on:
  - Data modeling from external data sources
  - Streams and functional-style queries
  - Grouping and aggregating domain data

## Technologies & tools

- Language: **Java**
- Paradigm: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Build tool: **Maven**
- Testing: **JUnit** (provided test suites from the course)
- Version control: **Git**, hosted on **GitHub**

These labs demonstrate my experience with **Java OOP design**, **clean project structure**, and **working with existing test suites** in a university context.
